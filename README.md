# Project Title: PlanetPulse(Disease Pridiction using Azure Custom Vision AI)
# Problem Statement:
The focal point of this project is to tackle the pressing challenge of identifying and effectively managing plant diseases within the realm of agriculture. Presently, farmers grapple with substantial crop losses stemming from diseases that go unnoticed, posing threats to both food security and sustainability. This initiative serves as a crucial link, utilizing advanced technology to promptly and precisely detect plant diseases. By doing so, it aims to mitigate the impact of undetected diseases on crops and contribute to the overall resilience and sustainability of agriculture.
# Project Description
Project Concept: At the heart of this initiative lies the utilization of advanced technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, to tackle the pervasive issue of undetected plant diseases in agriculture. The primary objective is to develop a user-friendly online platform dedicated to plant disease detection. This project seeks to empower farmers and agricultural experts with effective tools for promptly identifying and managing diseases affecting crops.

Problem Statement and Innovative Solution: The central challenge at hand is the delayed and inaccurate identification of plant diseases, resulting in significant global crop losses. The proposed solution revolves around the creation of a web-based platform where users can effortlessly upload images of diseased plants. These images undergo thorough analysis utilizing AI algorithms specifically trained to recognize various diseases. Subsequently, the system generates comprehensive reports detailing the identified disease, along with recommended control and prevention measures.

Addressing a Critical Need/Opportunity: The project directly caters to the urgent requirement for rapid and precise plant disease diagnosis. By introducing a solution that narrows the gap in current identification methods, it empowers farmers, agricultural experts, and stakeholders. The incorporation of technology into the platform streamlines the entire process, enabling users to make well-informed decisions promptly.

Objective and Operational Mechanism: The fundamental objective of the project aligns seamlessly with the prevalent agricultural challenge â€“ the imperative for efficient disease detection to ensure improved crop yields and food security. Operationally, the project features a straightforward yet robust user interface that facilitates image uploads. The core functionality revolves around AI-driven analysis of the uploaded images, providing users with a detailed diagnosis of the disease and practical recommendations for control and prevention. This streamlined functionality directly tackles the identified problem by offering an accessible and intuitive solution.
